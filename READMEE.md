## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size



## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I have learned alot in this challenge. One of this crucial thing that I have learned is CSS grids. I was able to do research and master the idea of css grid. There's another way I could have done it though. By using css flex



### Continued development

In the future (the next couple of days), I would like to focus on CSS flex. And a dip detail on CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me with CSS Grid, and Background Positioning
